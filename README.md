# Toys Revive

Toys Revive is a mobile app. Its main goal: Reduce toy clutters in households by encouraging toy donation.

### State of project

The project is a work-in-progress. The first version of the app is expected to be released during March 2024.

### History & Motivation

Toys Revive is a former school project I have developed during my 4th year in EPITECH. That year, I had the opportunity to attend to the Smart Mobile Development (SMD) semester at the Fontys University of Applied Sciences of Eindhoven, in the Netherlands.

This project was conducted with [Mikeyy01](https://github.com/Mikeyy01), a design student from Fontys.

At that time, the project was a mobile app skeleton with only a frontend. The backend wasn't a priority and wasn't a mandatory element of the project. The goal of Toys Revive was to address the challenge of excessive toy clutter in households. Our ambition was to develop toy donation and reduce the toy interest loss from kids.

When we turned the project in, I knew I was going to start working on that project again. When working on that project, I also enjoyed the Kotlin and Jetpack Compose syntax since I'm a great fan of Flutter and its declarative syntax.

In July 2023, I came back to France with one objective: Finish Toys Revive to release it. Then, in October 2023, I invited my friend [Arthi-Chaud](https://github.com/Arthi-Chaud) to contribute to the project as a backend developer.

### Acknowledgements & Thanks

- I want to thank [Mikeyy01](https://github.com/Mikeyy01) for his work on concepting, researching and design testing. Without him, the projet would not be where it is today.
- I also want to thank [Arthi-Chaud](https://github.com/Arthi-Chaud) for accepting to work with me on that project.
